This project is to implement best TDD practices. 

## Steps to approach a TDD solution:
**********
Step 1: Understand the problem statement, clarify doubts and discuss edge cases.

Step 2: (Write a failing test case) this step in TDD is to write a test case that captures the expected behavior of the function.

Step 3: Run test case , it should fail. Because you haven't implemented working classes yet, probably some compilation errors on IDE. 'Red Zone'

Step 4: Write minimum code to get rid of compilation error, like working classes and methods

Step 5: Try to implement the smallest piece of functionality, probably add a test case for an edge case, like when the input array is empty. 'Green Zone'

Step 6:
